# The Global Impact of Tuberculosis
## Overview
This project analyzes the global impact of Tuberculosis (TB) across different countries using the Tuberculosis Burden by Country dataset on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/sample-data). The analysis focuses on TB prevalence, incidence, mortality rates, and individuals with HIV, offering both statistical insights and visual representations through interactive plots and tableau dashboards. 

## Why It Matters
Tuberculosis continues to be one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases, especially in low-income countries. Understanding its distribution and the correlation with HIV helps health professionals target potential resources more effectively and develop strategies to reduce cases and mortality. 

## Key Insights
-	TB Incidence Peaked in the Early 2000s: Many countries experienced a sharp rise in TB cases in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with a decline starting around 2005.
-	Strong Correlation with HIV: Countries with higher HIV-positive populations showed significantly higher rates of TB incidence and mortality.
-	Geographic Disparities: TB remains heavily concentrated in certain regions, highlighting inequalities in healthcare access and disease management.
-	Persistent Burden: Despite overall declines, some countries still report high average rates of TB, particularly among HIV-positive individuals.
